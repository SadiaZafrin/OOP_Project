This code represents a basic Employee Management System GUI application built using Java Swing. The application provides a user interface for adding employee information and displaying the added employee details.

In this code I use 8 java swing features-

      1. labels,
      2. Text Fields,
      3. Combo box, 
      4. Radio Buttons, 
      5. Check box,
      6. Buttons,
      7. Background Image,
      8. Navigation.
      
Overall, this code provides a simple user interface for managing employee information, allowing users to add new employees and view their details. It can be further extended and enhanced to incorporate additional functionality and features as per the requirements of an Employee Management System.
